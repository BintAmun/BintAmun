### I am Ashley. A software engineer focused on security. I am committed to finding and fixing vulnerabilities in software at every stage of the Software Development Lifecycle. I enjoy studying and searching for ways an app might be manipulated by malicious (albeit clever) actors and closing security holes before they can be exploited.
